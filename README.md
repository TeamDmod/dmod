## Introduction
Here you can find all of Dmod.gg website source code, open issues and pull requests where needed. 

## Other information
Pull requests are maintained by our Code Reviewers. <br>
Issues should be reported to us through the repository's issues. 

## The Project 
We're building a platform connecting Community Owners with Moderators. We want to make the moderation team process within discord as seamless as possible, with as few stops as possible. We look forward to seeing your contributions.

## Contributing
### Version Controling
Always make a new branch or fork for your work, no matter how small the change is. This makes it easy for others to track each set of changes.

**Don’t** submit unrelated changes in the same branch/pull request! We shouldn’t have to reject your awesome bug fix because of a feature you bundled it with needs more work.

New features should branch off of the 'master' branch. Bug fixes should branch off whichever branch the bug effects

Note that depending on how long it takes for the dev team to merge your patch, the copy of 'master' you worked off of may get out of date! If you find yourself 'bumping' a pull request that’s been sidelined for a while, make sure you rebase or merge to latest master to ensure a speedier resolution.

### Code formatting

Follow the style you see used in the primary repository! Consistency with the rest of the project always trumps other considerations. It doesn’t matter if you have your own style or if the rest of the code breaks with the greater community - just follow along.

The appropriate formatting guidelines will be updated soon.
